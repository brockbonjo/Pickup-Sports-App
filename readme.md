# Pickups

As we age and get away from our childhood practices, it becomes harder and harder to find people to stay fit and have fun with.

We built our app to cater to people like:

Samantha, a manager who oversees multiple stores across the city of Austin who wants to play soccer at the end of her day without driving across town to her regular spot.

Steve, who has commitment issues, who finds himself with large blocks of time available to him last minute.

Mary, a general athlete who doesn't have soccer friends but wants to join a new sport.

## Future Plans

As we expand we want to more fully integrate Google Maps for better Pickup creation and direction. With this feature you'll be able to see all games happening around you to better find the pickup you want to play in.
